# Scripts Usage Guide

This directory contains several scripts that simplify the setup and management of your Galactica Network node. Here's a quick guide:

## Prerequisites

- Install `jq` for JSON processing.
- Ensure the `galacticad` command-line tool is installed and accessible.


- Set `GALACTICA_HOME` to your node's home directory, e.g., `export GALACTICA_HOME=~/.galactica`.
- Set `CHAIN_ID` to your network chain ID, e.g., `export CHAIN_ID=galactica_9301-1`.
- Set `NETWORK_PATH` to your network configuration directory, e.g., `export NETWORK_PATH=./network/testnet/$CHAIN_ID`.
- Set `KEYRING_BACKEND` to your keyring backend, e.g., `export KEYRING_BACKEND=test`. You can use various keyring backends such as `os`, `file`, `test`, `kwallet`, `pass`, etc. To read more about keyring backends, visit [Evmos documentation](https://docs.evmos.org/protocol/concepts/keyring#keyring-backends)

```sh
export GALACTICA_HOME=~/.galactica
export CHAIN_ID=galactica_9301-1
export NETWORK_PATH=./network/testnet/$CHAIN_ID
export KEYRING_BACKEND=file
```

## Scripts Overview

- **create-key.sh**: Creates a new private key for node security and transactions.
  ```bash
  ./scripts/create-key.sh
  ```
  Enter a key name when prompted. If the key exists, it will be displayed; otherwise, a new key is created.


- **create-home.sh**: Initializes the node's home directory with necessary configuration files. You can specify a custom home directory with the `GALACTICA_HOME` environment variable. This environment variable uses in all scripts.
  ```bash
  ./scripts/create-home.sh
  ```
  Enter a moniker and seed passphrase when prompted. The script will create a new home directory with provided moniker and private key.


- **create-tx.sh**: Generates a new genesis transaction (gentx) for registering your validator node.
  ```bash
  ./scripts/create-tx.sh
  ```
  Follow the prompts to input staking amount, validator node IP, and P2P port, etc. The script will generate a new gentx file in the `./network/testnet/galactica_9301-1/gentx` directory.


- **update-home.sh**: Updates the node's home directory with the latest configuration files.
  ```bash
  ./scripts/update-home.sh
  ```

- **show-key.sh**: Displays the node's private key.
  ```bash
  ./scripts/show-key.sh
  ```
  The script will display the public addresses in different formats and the private key if prompted.

- **import-mnemonic.sh**: Imports a mnemonic phrase into the keyring.
  ```bash
  ./scripts/import-mnemonic.sh
  ```
  Enter a mnemonic phrase when prompted. The script will import the mnemonic phrase into the keyring.

Please refer to the individual scripts for more detailed usage instructions.  The script will display the public addresses in different formats and the private key if prompted.
